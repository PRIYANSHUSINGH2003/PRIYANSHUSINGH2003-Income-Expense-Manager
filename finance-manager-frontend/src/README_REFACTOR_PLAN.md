# Refactor & Redesign Plan: Finance Manager Frontend

## 1. Directory Structure (Proposed)

```
src/
│
├── assets/                # Images, logos, icons, static files
├── components/            # Reusable UI components
│   ├── common/            # Buttons, modals, cards, etc.
│   ├── dashboard/         # Dashboard widgets, charts, summaries
│   ├── incomeExpense/     # Income/Expense forms, lists, filters
│   ├── invoices/          # Invoice generator, preview, list, domain forms
│   └── navigation/        # Sidebar, topbar, drawer, profile menu
│
├── context/               # React context providers (auth, theme, notifications)
├── hooks/                 # Custom React hooks
├── pages/                 # Page-level components (Dashboard, Invoices, Profile, etc.)
├── services/              # API calls, axios instances
├── theme/                 # MUI theme, color schemes, glassmorphism, dark/light mode
├── utils/                 # Utility functions, helpers
│
├── App.js
├── App.css
├── index.js
└── index.css
```

## 2. Refactor Steps
- Create new folders as per the structure above.
- Gradually move and split existing components into new folders (starting with dashboard, incomeExpense, invoices, navigation).
- Extract common UI elements (buttons, cards, modals) into `components/common`.
- Set up `context` for auth, theme, and notifications.
- Move API logic to `services`.
- Create a `theme` folder for advanced MUI theming (glassmorphism, dark/light mode, etc).
- Add `hooks` and `utils` for reusability.

## 3. UI/UX Redesign
- Adopt glassmorphism, soft shadows, animated transitions, and adaptive color themes.
- Ensure full responsiveness and accessibility.
- Redesign navigation for intuitive flows.

## 4. Feature Enhancements
- Real-time charts/graphs, smart summaries, expense categorization, secure auth, notifications, invoice generator upgrades, etc.
